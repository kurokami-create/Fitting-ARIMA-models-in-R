# Fitting-ARIMA-models-in-R
I will be using the in built R data sets in the "datasets" library, providing a step-step guide on how one can use R to fit ARIMA models to data sets.
This guide will include how to use residual analysis to confirm model fit as well as using the auto.arima() function of the "forecast" library to confirm our conclusions.
The dat sets used are: JohnsonJohnson, AirPassengers and uspop.
